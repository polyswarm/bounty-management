 # Bounty Mangement

 This application provides a basic interface for posting and viewing bounties on Polyswarm.

 ### Running the Manager

 Once you have the backend setup (including ipfs node, geth, and our python daemon) enter the following command.

```
 yarn start
 ```

 This will open the browser for you, but otherwise will be hosted at localhost:3000
